### Beyond the Code...

Outside the world of infrastructure and automation, **trading** is a strong passion of mine. I actively follow financial markets and analyze strategies, which helps me develop analytical thinking and quick decision-making skills â€“ abilities I often apply to complex technical challenges as well.
